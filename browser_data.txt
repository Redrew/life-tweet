In the case of Pique, he retired altogether from\nfootball in November.\n\nFormer Spain international Roberto has a contract that runs until June 30,\n2024, and it will be his last at Barca with a move elsewhere in Spain or to\nthe MLS possible.\n\nLike Busquets and Alba, Roberto dreams of lifting one last title as a Barca\nplayer and would this time do it as the leader of the team.\n\nDespite the player continually having the backing of Xavi, all the parties\ninvolved "assume, accept and understand" that these are Roberto\'s "last\nmonths" at the club of his life according to _SPORT_.\n\nRegardless of what happens from now until then, Roberto will go down in Barca\nfolklore as a loyal servant who won at least eight La Liga crowns and the\nChampions League twice as an academy graduate.\n\nFollow me on Twitter.\n\n![Tom\nSanderson](https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/34f2206e2aa0a03c5076ccba30fd03a5?s=400&d=mm&r=g)\n\nTom Sanderson\n\n  * Editorial Standards\n  * Print\n  * Reprints & Permissions\n\n
